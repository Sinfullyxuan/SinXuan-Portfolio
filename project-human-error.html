            <!-- <h2>Design Intent</h2> -->
            <p>Most if not all information and data are digitally stored assets on the Cloud. How can non-physical memories be manifested? And how physical artefacts be preserved and experienced digitally and vice versa? What is the embodiment of the space where this is curated and experienced?</p>
            <p>The atelier’s premise is to experiment as a phydigital curator, the spatial strategies within interior boundaries (loci) of and its relation to a place of memory (ars memoriae) – generated by interaction (consciousness).</p>
            <p>The curator will question the role of the society as the participant and observer, its implications of public information, perception and acquirement of shared memories and work towards developing responsive interiors and their opposites.</p>
            <p>Students utilize procedural digital design processes and experiment using collective parameters utilizing open data sources, studying established archives and applying generative interactive solutions in their design proposal.</p>

                <p>The adventure will consist of a mix of interactive activities with the use of technology and unconventional spaces. The visitor will be able to play and learn more about candy through engaging their 5 senses. The interaction with the sensorial exhibition will intrigue the mind and engross them into a fantasy of candy.</p>
